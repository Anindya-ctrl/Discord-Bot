__**Note**__: This bot is in development and so, issues might occur (some commands might appear to be incomplete or messy and they are). Please wait for a few moments if it seems to have crashed. The developer is currently working on other stuff, so the bot will remain as it is for an uncertain amount of time. Also, the bot is hosted on heroku for free (without credit card), so it might go offline anytime. That's all, have fun! :)
