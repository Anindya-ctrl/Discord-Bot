__**Note**__: This bot is in development and so, issues might occur (some commands might appear to be incomplete and/or messy and they are). Please wait for a few moments if it seems to have crashed. It will stay unusable while being developed. Also, the bot is hosted on heroku for free (without credit card), so it might go offline anytime. That's all, have fun! :)
